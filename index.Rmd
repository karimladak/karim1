## <span style="color:red">Summary</span>

My academic and professional experience focuses on the development and implementation of information technology solutions to solve complex business problems, particularly those involving data, its interpretation and associated quantitative analytics.  In particular, I have significant experience in mathematical model development and statistical analysis, with concomitant experience in business case development, project planning and management, technical design and software development of Business Intelligence, Data Warehousing and Mathematical/Statistical efforts, and have led or participated in teams that provided the foregoing solutions.

I have considerable experience in leading highly technical projects and teams. I have served as a Project Manager for several major quantitative projects with peak staff loading of over 15 staff and multi-million dollar budgets, and have led multidisciplinary teams that have developed various mathematical and statistical solutions for clients in the financial industry, power generation industry and in regulatory sectors. 

My recent technical experience includes the following: \textit{Statistical Data Analysis} (exploratory data analysis, multivariate analysis, and sampling plan development); \textit{Mathematical Algorithm Development} (securities market fraud detection, yield management algorithms, energy markets surveillance, manufacturing quality control); \textit{Software Coding and Development} (Visual Studio, Python, SQL, PHP, C/C++, VBA, Javascript, R Statistical System and RStudio); \textit{Report Writing} (expert witness reports, strategic analysis reports, requirements specifications, software design documents, coding standards); \textit{Project Management} (utilizing project management methodologies to manage multidisciplinary teams of over 15 staff and budgets of over \$5 million); as well as Proposal Development and Presentation, and Contract Negotiation.
