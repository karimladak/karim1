## Summary

My academic and professional experience focuses on the development and implementation of information technology solutions to solve complex business problems, particularly those involving data, its interpretation and associated quantitative analytics.  In particular, I have significant experience in mathematical model development and statistical analysis, with concomitant experience in business case development, project planning and management, technical design and software development of Business Intelligence, Data Warehousing and Mathematical/Statistical efforts, and have led or participated in teams that provided the foregoing solutions.

I have considerable experience in leading highly technical projects and teams. I have served as a Project Manager for several major quantitative projects with peak staff loading of over 15 staff and multi-million dollar budgets, and have led multidisciplinary teams that have developed various mathematical and statistical solutions for clients in the financial industry, power generation industry and in regulatory sectors. 

My recent technical experience includes the following: \textit{Statistical Data Analysis} (exploratory data analysis, multivariate analysis, and sampling plan development); \textit{Mathematical Algorithm Development} (securities market fraud detection, yield management algorithms, energy markets surveillance, manufacturing quality control); \textit{Software Coding and Development} (Visual Studio, Python, SQL, PHP, C/C++, VBA, Javascript, R Statistical System and RStudio); \textit{Report Writing} (expert witness reports, strategic analysis reports, requirements specifications, software design documents, coding standards); \textit{Project Management} (utilizing project management methodologies to manage multidisciplinary teams of over 15 staff and budgets of over \$5 million); as well as Proposal Development and Presentation, and Contract Negotiation.

abcdef It's possible to create well-designed websites for free using [RStudio's R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and hosting them on [Github](http://github.com). This is very new and incredibly cool. It is a really powerful way to communicate science using the same reproducible workflow you use for your analyses and collaborations.

***Creating websites with R Markdown can be done without knowing R or HTML, CSS, etc,*** and that's where we'll start. However, R Markdown integrates with these tools so the more you know the more complex and beautiful your website can be. This tutorial borrows heavily from a lot of great tutorials and resources you should check out too -- there are links throughout. 

The best way to learn is to follow along with your own laptop, but all are welcome. We'll spend half the time with the tutorial and half the time for you to work on your own website and get help. If you bring your laptop please do this beforehand: 

1. install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
1. create a [GitHub]((http://github.com)) account ([advice](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html))
1. set up your computer to talk to GitHub
    - have RStudio linked directly (preferred) ([instructions sections 8-14](http://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html))
    - or install the [Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/)
    - or be familiar with git commands for the command line ([tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1))

**Examples:**

We have been using R Markdown for the Ocean Health Index:  [**ohi-science.org/ohi-global**](http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global).  
And R Markdown is much more than just websites -- here's a [**one-minute video about R Markdown**](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) to get you excited.
